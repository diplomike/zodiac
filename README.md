This code should be read in conjunction with my paywalled article "My challenge to horoscope believers" on Medium:

It is a simulation to confirm the 1% confidence level for predicting the zodiac signs of 180 subjects correctly simply by guessing. 

The results show that it corresponds to a rate of approximately 13%, consistent with my calculations in the article.

In other words, if somesomne can outperform this accurarcy in predicting the zodiac signs via personality or other demographic info, 
it can be a proof that zodiac signs do hold some specific qualities about human beings.
